# donationDatabase
Team 10's KU computer science capstone project 2016-2017.

The donation database is a deployable software solution for a nonprofit
to organize and streamline their physical donation system. It allows for
donors to donate specific items that the donees request, as well as allowing
for monetary donations for the nonprofit to use. This software will match 
donees with the donations the nonprofit receives via a customizable donation 
matching algorithm.
